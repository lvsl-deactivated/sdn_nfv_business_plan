# Business offering and Target Customer(s) #
## Description of Business Offering and Customer Segments ##
RIBCloud service offers cloud based solution for managing changes in routing within networking infrastructure.
The product allows deep monitoring and real-time analytics such as:
capacity planning for internal IP space exhaustion,
tracking changes in routing protocols configuration, surfacing bottleneck in network topology, etc.

RIBCloud target are large companies with complex physical network infrastructure.
Potential customers are network engineers and managers working within the organisation on reducing CAPEX and OPEX costs of maintaining and scaling the network.

The second potential customer segment are transit providers and network operators. This business require constant scaling as Internet continues to grow.

## Cloud based service/product ##
RIBCloud is a cloud based service. The backend and API operate fully in the cloud. This API is not directly available to the customer, but via management components
deployed in customer's infrastructure. These on-premises components provided addition layer of availability by buffering data in case of cloud's unavailability.

## Factors and processes which lead you to select the offering and target customer segments ##

I found that Emergent Strategy works best for this startup since it's customers are existing enterprise businesses. 
The SDN and NFV initiatives are lead by the following organisations:

* Open Networking Foundation (ONF): "Is a user-driven organization dedicated to the promotion and adoption of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) through open standards development"
* OpenDaylight: "Is a collaborative project under The Linux Foundation to foster innovation and create an open and transparent approach to Software-Defined Networking"
* ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute: "Produces globally-applicable standards for Information and Communications Technologies (ICT)"

Joining these organisation will be an important strategic move. The opportunity is to have direct access to industry leaders.

## Legal and Regulatory Best Practices ##

The company is structures as a Private Limited Company which provide Protection of limited liability and easy to attract new people by providing shares in the business.
The name "RIBCloud" should be registered the domain name should be "ribcloud.io". Such legal documents as Conditions of Incorporation, Rules of the Company and FormA1
must be filled before starting the company. NDA must be signed by every employee. Employee contract should ensure leak of Intellectual Property is minimised.

SLA with customers should be negotiated with every customers separately.
This is driven by a strategic choice that initially the startup should have few loyal customers with deep integration.

Shares should be granted under Shareholder's agreement and include:
business on the company, financing, administration, veto rights, transfer of shares, restrictive covenants, termination, dispute resolution. 

All legal documents have to be stored in few redundant systems.
The company plans to use "Bring You Own Device" policy and support remote collaboration via trusted set of tools. This should be reflected in the Contract of Employment.
The company will not be doing on-line sales, only b2b bank transfers.
Data Protection Act must be taken into account, customers should be able to able to extract their personal data without causing any major operational issues.

### Using and Publishing Open Source Software ### 
Some parts of the software may be release as Open Source Software (OSS). The list of "blessed" licences must be provided by legal team. In case an employee wants to use
OSS internally or as part of distribution, he or she must comply with legal representative to prevent potential leakage of Intellectual Property caused by using OSS with
restrictive licence in distribution.

* *In this section, you also need to state clearly what is your value proposition for your targeted customers and how Cloud based services are supporting this value proposition* 

The unique value of RIBCloud is the ability to tap into real-time routing information and expose it in the vendor agnostic open format.
For enterprise customers this will help surface bottlenecks in their network, help troubleshoot network related outages.
For transit providers and operators this will help to reduce the time of network topology change and allow to execute scheduled maintenance with less impact to their customers.
