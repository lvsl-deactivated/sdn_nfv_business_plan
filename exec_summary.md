# Executive Summary #

Historically enterprise networks were driven by large vendors who provide vertical solution for different network functions (e.g. routing, NAT, load balancing).
These solutions are mainframes with very steep price curve and poor scaling factor.

Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) are new emerging technologies
which allow business owners to build and evolve network infrastructure as if it is a cloud service leveraging open standards, Open-Source Software and economies of scale in warehouse-scale computing.

The startup business plan has been centered around the need of large enterprises and service providers of scalable open solution for routing traffic at different levels of the network.

This startup addresses two most important issues in network switches and routers: vendor lock-in of Routing Information Base (RIB)
and inability to scale routers horizontally.

The cloud technologies allow just-in-time delivery of the new versions of the software in RIBCloud and reduce the amount of hardware required to be installed in the customer's network.
